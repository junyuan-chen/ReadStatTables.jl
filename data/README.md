The datasets named `sample.*`s are copied from [pyreadstat](https://github.com/Roche/pyreadstat/tree/master/test_data) for testing purposes.
The Stata file `sample.dta` is slightly modified for wider test coverage.
The Stata files `alltypes.dta` and `stringtypes.dta`
are generated by `alltypes.do` and `stringtypes.do` respectively.
